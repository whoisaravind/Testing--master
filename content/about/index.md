Hello! I'm a product of evolution.

Currently working as a Management Trainee at [BSH](https://www.bsh-group.com/) and outside work, I occasionally blog on [Medium](https://medium.com/@aravindnk).

At college, I led the Business team and was a venue coordinator at [One India One World](https://happenings.lpu.in/results-of-one-india-one-world-2019/) by leading the team of 20+ Volunteers and managed 3500+ footprints.

Prior to that was scaling the management vertical of [Spic Macay](https://spicmacaylpu.wixsite.com/website), and Supervised a team of 10 to initiate a digital presence. Designed and launched the website.

Here is a list of the things that I'm familiar with!
